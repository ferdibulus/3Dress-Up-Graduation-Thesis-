# 3Dress-Up-Graduation-Thesis-

My graduation thesis's goal is about how can I or Companies sell clothes more efficiently on the Internet. I researched and gain some informations about online shopping. The main idea of this project that People can try their favorites clothes in 3D. Let me explain what does it mean 3D? 3D or I called 3Dress-Up is an e-commerce website that is created for Online Shopping that this website contains clothes that are shown 3d and photos. User or Customers can sign in and import their 3d model then they can try clothes whatever they want in 3d. They can change the clothes color, size, scale. After that, They pay their clothes prices. Both Producer and Customer will benefit by using this project. I almost finished this project and I will upload it into the Internet soon. I use Html/Css/Js/Bootstrap/Ajax/Sweatalert/Three.js/WebGL/Babylon.js for Frontend and PHP/MySql for Backend.
